2025 has had a lot of surprises. Many good, some heavy. It's lovely to be moving into Advent of Code season, just like you can tuck into a warm hot chocolate at the end of a long, cold day. 

I didn't wake up extraordinarily early this year to take on AoC. 

I laughed really, really hard at the elves discovering project management.

I had the right idea for Part 1, but I wasn't granular enough in my thinking for Part 2. I had to revisit my logic and break it down very small. Eventually I figured it out, but realized I had written over my original Part 1. Oh well, I just refactored to solve Part 1 a different way. :)

Tbh, I had more trouble making my espresso this morning than I did completing this, which means I'm getting better at considering edge cases. (My Saint Frank espresso order should be here tomorrow, which will help a lot. :D)

I really like the new format I'm working with in considering scenarios first. Maybe I should have been doing this all along? I fought pretty hard against showing my work in math as well... but this helped me figure out pretty quickly the one edge case I had not covered. 3 attempts and 2 right answers, I will call this a win for today. :)
