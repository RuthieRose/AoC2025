2025 has had a lot of surprises. Many good, some heavy. It's lovely to be moving into Advent of Code season, just like you can tuck into a warm hot chocolate at the end of a long, cold day. 

I didn't wake up extraordinarily early this year to take on AoC. 

I laughed really, really hard at the elves discovering project management.

I had the right idea for Part 1, but I wasn't granular enough in my thinking for Part 2. I had to revisit my logic and break it down very small. Eventually I figured it out, but realized I had written over my original Part 1. Oh well, I just refactored to solve Part 1 a different way. :)

Tbh, I had more trouble making my espresso this morning than I did completing this, which means I'm getting better at considering edge cases. (My Saint Frank espresso order should be here tomorrow, which will help a lot. :D)

I really like the new format I'm working with in considering scenarios first. Maybe I should have been doing this all along? I fought pretty hard against showing my work in math as well... but this helped me figure out pretty quickly the one edge case I had not covered. 3 attempts and 2 right answers, I will call this a win for today. :)

Woke up before my alarm and had part 1 done before coffee. No difficulties with pulling a shot this morning, but my Saint Frank espresso will not in fact be here today (long sad story with UPS) so I have to settle for not-Saint Frank beans until we can get that figured out. 

Different approach for Part 2 day! 

It was interesting because I had more internal resistance to writing out my scenario this morning, but I realized that is exactly why I need to clearly articulate my strategy before I start throwing code out. 

I got both gold stars on the first try this morning, and still doing this with zero AI help. We'll see if I can keep this up for the entirety of the 12 days.

Stayed up this time?? Why??? I have a day job and I need to function!!

Haha in all seriousness I got this one completed pretty quickly considering I recreated my grid utility from scratch and I was up at 4 a.m. 

Part 2 set up with a while loop I was able to exit with setting a flag. Considering the long day I had, I managed to think pretty clearly which was nice. It was especially great that I got both gold stars on the first try. And yes, I'm still AI-free. I'm loving how these little thinking exercises are feeling for my brain.

Whew. Life got to me today--I had some really important meetings at work and I did not have much time to dedicate to AoC this morning before work. In addition, I just couldn't get the logic right and had to debug the hell out of my solution to understand what I was doing wrong. It was simple and made perfect sense once I got it figured out, but some days are just more taxing than others. I finished just under the 24-hour mark.

What's going on? What day is it? Why am I recreating pivots in Python? What is sleep? (Still 100% organic btw!)

Day 6 done!!

Made a choice to sleep last night and had some family time this morning, so did not get started on this one until later in the day. 

Part 1 I got very quickly.

Part 2 I felt very, very dumb. While it had been some since I had done dfs, I had a feeling that I would not be able to make vanilla dfs would work for this.

After a couple of drawings to understand the setup better and watching the first part of Neetcode's Unique Paths explainer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlEsdxuD4lY), I was able to set up the problem so that I could calculate the number of valid paths per position. 

This was a nice challenge and made me realize I miss leetcoding on the regular. It was also nice to be able to find an explainer on a concept and adapt it for AoC without it taking me the entire day to figure out. 

Still no AI, and I'm enjoying so much just brushing back up on concepts and figuring things out as I go.

I really hope I have time to finish out AoC this week!
